## Reflection Document

### Reflection – 01-HTML Section

#### Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I was able to complete the exercises independently using the lecture slides, DevTools, and some light experimentation. Re-creating the layouts based on the snapshot helped reinforce the structure of valid HTML and how different elements behave in the browser.

#### How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

These exercises were very helpful for building confidence with basic HTML syntax. The form exercise was especially useful — not only did it pull together a variety of input types, but it also made me think more carefully about accessibility and logical grouping using `<fieldset>` and `<label>` elements.

#### Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

It would’ve been helpful to have a bit more guidance on when to use `<section>` vs `<div>` in layout-based HTML, and maybe a deeper explanation of accessibility attributes like `aria-*` even at this early stage. But overall, the material was clear and straightforward.

#### Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

An additional exercise involving anchor navigation — like linking sections within a page or between pages — could have tied everything together nicely. It would’ve offered some practice in thinking about flow and document navigation. That said, the four exercises we had were a great introduction to structural HTML.
